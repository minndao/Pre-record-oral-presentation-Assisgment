⚔️ Java RPG Battle SystemA console-based, turn-based battle simulation developed to demonstrate the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project simulates a dynamic fight between different character classes—Warrior, Wizard, and Archer—each featuring unique combat mechanics, resource management systems, and polymorphic behaviors.📂 RepositoryView the Source Code:👉 GitHub Repository: Pre-record Oral Presentation Assignment📺 Video DemonstrationWatch the full oral presentation and system walkthrough, including a code breakdown and Q&A session:Presenter: Lee Ming DaoTopic: PTG Exercise OCC 9 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java🏗️ Core OOP Principles AppliedThis system strictly adheres to the four pillars of OOP to ensure modularity and scalability:1. Abstraction 🧩The Character class is defined as an abstract class. It outlines the blueprint for all fighters (containing name, health, attackPower) but prevents the instantiation of a generic "Character." It enforces that all subclasses must implement their own version of specialMove().2. Inheritance 🧬The Warrior, Wizard, and Archer classes use the extends keyword to inherit shared logic from the parent Character class. This includes methods like:takeDamage(): Handles health reduction.isAlive(): Checks if the character is still in the fight.Constructor Chaining: Child classes use super() to pass initialization data back to the parent.3. Polymorphism 🎭The specialMove() method is overridden (@Override) in each subclass. While the main battle loop calls the same method name for every character, the behavior changes at runtime based on the object type (e.g., a Shield Bash vs. a Fireball).4. Encapsulation 💊Sensitive data is protected using private and protected access modifiers.Internal State: Attributes like mana (Wizard) and arrowCount (Archer) are private.Controlled Access: State changes only occur through specific methods like recharge() or reload(), preventing external classes from setting invalid values.🎮 Character ClassesClassUnique AttributeSpecial MoveResource Mechanic🛡️ WarriorshieldStrengthShield BashIncreases damage based on shield defense; triggers a battleCry() for immersion.🧙‍♂️ WizardmanaFireballCosts 10 Mana. If mana is insufficient, the turn is spent calling recharge() (+20 Mana).🏹 ArcherarrowCountTriple ShotCosts 3 Arrows. If arrows are empty, the turn is spent calling reload() (+10 Arrows).🛠️ How It WorksInitialization: In BattleSystem.java, characters are instantiated with specific stats (e.g., Arthur the Warrior starts with 100 HP).The Battle Loop: A while loop continues execution as long as both combatants return true for isAlive().Randomized AI: Using java.util.Random, the system decides each turn whether a character performs a Normal Attack or attempts a Special Move.Automatic Resource Recovery: If a character tries to use a special move but lacks resources (e.g., 0 Mana), they automatically switch to a recovery action for that turn.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesJava Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.Installation & ExecutionClone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/minndao/Pre-record-oral-presentation-Assisgment.git
